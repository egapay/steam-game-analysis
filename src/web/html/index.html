            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              In this project, I will be doing an analysis of the top 100 Steam
              games since March 2009. I will giving a detailed report of the
              entire analysis process starting from data extraction,
              transformation, and loading, to visualization.

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              My goal is to grasp a better understanding of what makes these
              games top the Steam charts since 2009. I will explore these
              questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between game price and average playtime?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between number of positive reviews and
                average playtime?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between number of positive and total
                reviews?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between total reviews and average
                playtime?
              </li>
              <li>Do paid games have more positive reviews than free games?</li>
              <li>Are there more paid or free games in the top 100?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Extraction</h2>
            <p>
              I did research looking for data that was both meaningful and
              convenient to retrieve. I first searched on Kaggle looking at
              these two datasets:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset"
                  >Dataset 1</a
                >
                data seemed to be a strong candidate as there were a lot of
                different fields to do analysis off of. However, upon further
                inspection of the data it looked to be incorrect and/or
                outdated. I decided to look at another dataset I had more
                confidence in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games/data"
                  >Dataset 2</a
                >
                also seemed promising but looking at the data, it was outdated
                about 5 years.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              With no other publicly and readily available datasets to choose
              from, I decided I had to create my own. I looked at various
              websites that holds information about Steam's games. These
              included SteamDB, Steam's Official API, and Steam Spy.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://steamdb.info/"><strong>SteamDB</strong></a> is
                a third party website that collects data from Steam and allows
                you to view more in-depth information such as price changes and
                app ID. They also provide additional tools such as Steam charts,
                sales, and account calculator. This seemed like the best way to
                gather information as I planned on web scraping the info from
                this website. Unfortunately, web scraping was prohibited from
                the website, so I had to explore other options.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home"
                  ><strong>Steam's Official API</strong></a
                >
                was another option I considered, grabbing information directly
                from the source. Using Steam's
                <a href="https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/"
                  >API</a
                >, I grabbed a list of appIDs I would use to gather the
                information. By making a GET request using the respective appID:
                <a
                  href="https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids=550"
                  >https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids=550</a
                >, I could gather a list of each games information and store it.
                This process seemed to be the best solution, but I came across
                an issue regarding API rate limiting. Steam only allows about
                100,000 request a day and about 1 request every 10 seconds.
                Gathering the data of this list of games would take over a month
                to complete. Again, the information is there but not readily
                available for use.
