            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              In this project, I will be doing an analysis of the top 100 Steam
              games since March 2009. I will giving a detailed report of the
              entire analysis process starting from data extraction,
              transformation, and loading, to visualization.

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              My goal is to grasp a better understanding of what makes these
              games top the Steam charts since 2009. I will explore these
              questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between game price and average playtime?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between number of positive reviews and
                average playtime?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between number of positive and total
                reviews?
              </li>
              <li>Do paid games have more positive reviews than free games?</li>
              <li>Are the more paid or free games in the top 100?</li>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between total reviews and average
                playtime?
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Extraction</h2>
            <p>
              I did a lot of research looking for data that was both meaningful
              and convenient to retrieve. I first searched on Kaggle looking at
              these two datasets:
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset"
                >Dataset 1</a
              >,
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games/data"
                >Dataset 2</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Dataset 1 data seemed to be a strong candidate as there were a lot
              of different fields to do analysis off of. However, upon further
              inspection of the data it looked to be incorrect and/or outdated.
              I decided to go with another dataset I had more confidence in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dataset 2 also seemed promising but looking at the data, it was
              outdated about 5 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              With no other publicly and readily available datasets to choose
              from, I decided I had to create my own.
