            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              In this project, I will be doing an analysis of the top 100 Steam
              games since March 2009. I will giving a detailed report of the
              entire analysis process starting from data extraction,
              transformation, and loading, to visualization and analysis.

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              My goal is to grasp a better understanding of what makes these
              games top the Steam charts since 2009. I will explore these
              questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between game price and average playtime?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between number of positive reviews and
                average playtime?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between number of positive and total
                reviews?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the correlation between total reviews and average
                playtime?
              </li>
              <li>Do paid games have more positive reviews than free games?</li>
              <li>Are there more paid or free games in the top 100?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Extraction</h2>
            <p>
              I did research looking for data that was both meaningful and
              convenient to retrieve. I first searched on Kaggle looking at
              these two datasets:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset"
                  >Dataset 1</a
                >
                data seemed to be a strong candidate as there were a lot of
                different fields to do analysis off of. However, upon further
                inspection of the data it looked to be incorrect and/or
                outdated. I decided to look at another dataset I had more
                confidence in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games/data"
                  >Dataset 2</a
                >
                also seemed promising but looking at the data, it was outdated
                about 5 years.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With no other publicly and readily available datasets to choose
              from, I decided I had to create my own. I looked at various
              websites that holds information about Steam's games. These
              included SteamDB, Steam's Official API, and Steam Spy.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://steamdb.info/"><strong>SteamDB</strong></a> is
                a third party website that collects data from Steam and allows
                you to view more in-depth information such as price changes and
                app ID. They also provide additional tools such as Steam charts,
                sales, and account calculator. This seemed like the best way to
                gather information as I planned on web scraping the info from
                this website. Unfortunately, web scraping was prohibited from
                the website, so I had to explore other options.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home"
                  ><strong>Steam's Official API</strong></a
                >
                was another option I considered, grabbing information directly
                from the source. Using Steam's
                <a href="https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/"
                  >API</a
                >, I grabbed a list of appIDs I would use to gather the
                information. By making a GET request using the respective appID:
                <a
                  href="https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids=550"
                  >https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids=550</a
                >, I could gather a list of each games information and store it.
                This process seemed to be the best solution, but I came across
                an issue regarding API rate limiting. Steam only allows about
                100,000 request a day and about 1 request every 10 seconds.
                Gathering the data of this list of games would take over a month
                to complete. Again, the information is there but not readily
                available for use.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://steamspy.com/api.php"
                  ><strong>Steam Spy's API</strong></a
                >
                is a similar website to SteamDB where they track Steam game
                information. This website, however, has a publicly available API
                which has the all the correct information needed: price, average
                playtime, reviews, etc. I ended up using this API to extract my
                data from as it was up-to-date and accurate.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After deciding to go with Steam Spy's API, I moved on to
              transforming the data.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Transformation</h2>
            <p>
              I will be using <strong>Python</strong> with
              <strong>Pandas</strong> to extract and transform the data.
            </p>

            <div class="code-explain">
              <p>
                Here we only have to make a single request to the API endpoint
                which will get all the information necessary. Only needing to
                call once solves our rate limiting issue:

                  There is a very weak (0.1 > x > 0.0) correlation between these
                  two fields. This indicates that price does not have a
                  determining factor on whether or not a game is played for a
                  long time. This primarily depends on game genre such as story
                  games or games that have competitive play. Story games have a
                  definitive end to them meaning that after players finish the
                  main story, there is not much more content to spend in the
                  game, reducing the average playtime compared to games with
                  competitive play. We can see a couple of these story games at
                  $60 with Red Dead Redemption 2, Hogwarts Legacy, and Baldur's
                  Gate 3. Games with competitive play tend to see a greater
                  playtime due to their returning players continuing to try and
                  get a better rank. We can see two of these games, Dota 2 and
                  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (<i
                    >now called Counter-Strike 2</i
                  >) with two of the highest average playtimes. These games have
                  both competitive play and are free.

                  There is a moderate correlation (0.8 > x > 0.5) between these
                  two fields. Those who played longer or games that have longer
                  playtimes tend to receive more positive reviews. This
                  potentially could be because players felt like they got their
                  money's worth with the purchase of the game and the time spent
                  playing. The graph above shows most of the data sitting around
                  the 5 to 300 hour range, with it slightly moving up the more
                  average hours. We see two outliers again with Dota and
                  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as they both exceed the
                  average range by almost double. Again, with the type of games
                  they are, they tend to move away from the trend.

                  We can see there is a strong correlation (1 > x > 0.8) between
                  these two fields. This means the majority of the reviews left
                  on a top rated game tended to be positive. This shows that
                  players are willing to give give a game a review if they
                  enjoyed playing it. This correlation also suggest that the
                  more reviews these top games have, the more likely the
                  majority of the reviews will be positive. We can see this
                  trend in the graph above where there is a direct correlation
                  between the two.

                  There is a moderate correlation (0.8 > x > 0.5) between these
                  two fields. Players who have played the game longer will most
                  likely give a review to the game. This shows the willingness a
                  player has the more time invested in a game to express their
                  opinions. We can see an upward trend in the data showing the
                  more reviews a game has the higher average playtime the player
                  has.

                  Although there are more paid games in the top 100, we can see
                  proportionally free games have more average positive reviews.
                  This shows that paid games do not always provide more
                  meaningful positive outcomes than if it were free. A possible
                  reasoning for this is players will be more inclined to leave a
                  positive review since they got game content without having to
                  buy anything.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              There is not one single factor that makes a game top the Steam
              charts for years. The amount of playtime a player can get out of a
              game has a good influence on the games reviews. Additionally, the
              game being free vs. paid has a great effect on reviews as well.
              Lastly, the game type is a driving factor into how many hours
              players spend in the game. Competitive games turns players into
              spending more hours in game, which then inclines them to leave
              more positive reviews. Story games on the other hand, look to
              provide great game content which inclines players to leave more
              positive reviews.

              An interesting trend I saw with the different graphs were the two
              consistent outliers, Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
              These two games were both created by Valve (<i>who owns Steam</i>)
              so there potentially could be another reasoning for why these top
              the charts aside from their content or game type.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              There is a lot that goes into making a great game and have it top
              the Steam charts for years. Through this research, I hoped to have
              given more insight on why these games do. For further work on this
              analysis, I would like to find another way of retrieving this
              similar data and compare it to mine to ensure consistency across
              all fields. Additionally, I would like to look more into different
              fields within these games such as their game type (genre) and
              release date.
